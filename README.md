# CDR Group

**CDR Group** is an independent research-driven organization working at the intersection of  
**cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and computational systems**.

We focus on building **theoretical frameworks**, **agent architectures**, and **experimental systems** that explore how complex behavior, decision-making, and internal dynamics emerge from formal models.

## What We Work On

### 🧠 Cognitive Science & Consciousness
- Functional and computational models of cognition  
- Formal approaches to consciousness, agency, and internal state dynamics  
- Bridging neuroscience-inspired principles with artificial systems  

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Agents
- Autonomous agent architectures  
- Memory-, value-, and policy-driven decision systems  
- Beyond stateless chatbots: long-term consistency and internal dynamics  

### 📐 Formal & Mathematical Models
- Information-theoretic metrics  
- Entropy, collapse dynamics, and system-level constraints  
- Testable, falsifiable hypotheses instead of metaphysics

## Core Philosophy

> If a phenomenon cannot be **modeled**, it cannot be **tested**.  
> If it cannot be tested, it does not belong to science.

CDR Group prioritizes:
- **Operational definitions**
- **Measurable internal states**
- **Reproducible experiments**
- **Minimal assumptions, maximal explanatory power**

We deliberately avoid speculative metaphysics and focus on **models that do real work**.

---

## Ongoing Directions

- FCCT-based agent architectures  
- Dynamic memory and value systems  
- Qualia-space representations and embeddings  
- Cognitive load, collapse dynamics, and behavioral prediction  

(Some projects are private or experimental and not yet public.)

## Why “CDR”?

CDR stands for **Cognitive Dynamics Research**.

It reflects our core interest:  
how cognition emerges, evolves, destabilizes, and reorganizes under pressure.

---

## Status

This organization is **active**, **experimental**, and **evolving**.

Public repositories will appear as projects mature.  
Early-stage work may remain internal until it reaches scientific or engineering readiness.
